    <h1>Privacy Policy - LLM Website Translator</h1>
    <p>Last Updated: [2025-04-11]</p> 

    <p>This privacy policy explains how the "LLM Website Translator" Chrome extension ("the Extension") handles your information.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Process</h2>
    <p>The Extension processes the following types of information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Web Page Content:</strong> To provide the translation functionality, the Extension accesses and processes the text content of the web pages you choose to translate.</li>
        <li><strong>User Configuration Settings:</strong> Information you configure in the Extension's options page, such as your chosen API provider, API key, API endpoint URL, target language, model name, and other operational settings (batch size, delay, etc.).</li>
        <li><strong>(Optional) Contact Information:</strong> If you voluntarily contact us for support via the provided Google Form, we may collect your email address.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Web Page Content:</strong> The text content of the web page is sent to the third-party translation API provider you select in the settings (e.g., Google Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek, xAI, or your self-hosted Ollama/LM Studio instance) solely for the purpose of obtaining a translation. <strong>This text content is NOT stored or logged by the Extension developer.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>User Configuration Settings:</strong> These settings are stored locally on your computer using `chrome.storage.local` and are used only to operate the Extension according to your preferences and to make requests to your chosen API provider. <strong>API keys are masked in the options interface but may be stored as plain text within Chrome's local storage on your device. The Extension developer does NOT have access to this local storage.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>(Optional) Contact Information:</strong> Your email address, if provided via the Google Form, is used exclusively for responding to your support inquiries.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Sharing and Third Parties</h2>
    <p>We share information only in the following circumstances:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>With API Providers:</strong> When you initiate a translation, the text content of the current page is sent to the API provider you have configured. Your use of these third-party services is subject to their respective privacy policies. We encourage you to review them:
            <ul>
                <li>Google Gemini: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a></li>
                <li>OpenAI: <a href="https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy" target="_blank">https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy</a></li>
                <li>Anthropic: <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://www.anthropic.com/privacy</a></li>
                <li>DeepSeek: <a href="https://deepseek.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://deepseek.com/privacy</a> (Link may vary, please check their official site)</li>
                <li>xAI: <a href="https://x.ai/privacy" target="_blank">https://x.ai/privacy</a> (Link may vary, please check their official site)</li>
                <li>Ollama/LM Studio: If you use a self-hosted endpoint, data is sent to the URL you provide. Ensure you understand the privacy implications of your own server setup.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>With Google (for Support):</strong> If you use the Google Form for support, the information you submit (including your email address) is processed by Google according to their privacy policy: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Other than the above, the Extension developer does not share your configuration settings or web page content with any other third parties.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Storage, Protection, and Retention</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Web Page Content:</strong> Processed temporarily in memory during translation and NOT stored persistently by the Extension or the developer.</li>
        <li><strong>User Configuration Settings:</strong> Stored locally on your device using `chrome.storage.local`. Protection relies on the security measures of your Chrome browser and operating system. These settings are retained until you change them, clear them, or uninstall the Extension.</li>
        <li><strong>(Optional) Contact Information:</strong> Email addresses submitted via Google Forms are retained only as long as necessary to address your support request [Optional: Add a specific retention period, e.g., "and are deleted within 90 days after the issue is resolved."].</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>You have the right to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Access, modify, or clear your configuration settings stored locally via the Extension's options page or by clearing browser data.</li>
        <li>Request access, correction, or deletion of your email address if you have submitted it for support by contacting us.</li>
        <li>Uninstall the Extension at any time, which will remove locally stored configuration data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Policy Updates</h2>
    <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify you of any significant changes by updating the policy on the Chrome Web Store listing page for the Extension. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.</p>
